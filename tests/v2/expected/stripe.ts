   * Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in
   * your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event`
   * object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
   * event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
   * `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
   * events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
   * customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
   * `charge.succeeded` event.
   *
   * Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
   * resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
   * example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
   * `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.
   *
   * As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
   * [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
   * from the API. We also have a separate
   * [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
   * `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed
   * in your
   * [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks'),
   * and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.
   *
   * When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
   * events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
   * additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.
   *

   * guaranteed only for 30 days.

   * If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
   * [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic'),
   * Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
   * emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
   *
   * Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the

   * per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the

   * A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
   * For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
   * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
   *
   * Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
   * Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
   * The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
   * you through the setup process.
   *
   * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
   * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
   * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
   * in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
   * If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
   * it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
   * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
   * PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
   *
   * By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,

This allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.
           *
           * Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).
           *
           * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.
