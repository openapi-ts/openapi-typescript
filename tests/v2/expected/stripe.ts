   * A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
   * For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
   * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
   *
   * Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
   * Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
   * The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
   * you through the setup process.
   *
   * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
   * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
   * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
   * in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
   * If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
   * it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
   * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
   * PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
   *
   * By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
   * even as regulations change over time.
   *
