     * You can delete one analysis at a time.
     * To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.
     * Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
     * 
     * When you list the analyses for a repository,
     * one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
     * 
     * ```
     * "deletable": true
     * ```
     * 
     * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
     * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
     * for each enabled code scanning tool,
     * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
     * 
     * * `ref`
     * * `tool`
     * * `category`
     * 
     * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
     * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
     * 
     * ```
     * Analysis specified is not deletable.
     * ```
     * 
     * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
     * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:
     * `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.
     * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
     * in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
     * for the specified tool in your repository.
     * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
     * When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
     * in the 200 response is `null`.
     * 
     * As an example of the deletion process,
     * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
     * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
     * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
     * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
     * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
     * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
     * To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
     * Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.
     * Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
     * delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
     * Then repeat the process for the second set.
     * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
     * 
     * **Outer loop**:
     * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
     * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
     * 
     *   **Inner loop**:
     *   * Delete the identified analysis.
     *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.

     * Create a deployment 
     * @description Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.
     * 
     * The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
     * before we merge a pull request.
     * 
     * The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
     * multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
     * makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
     * 
     * The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
     * the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
     * the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
     * return a failure response.
     * 
     * By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
     * state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
     * specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
     * not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
     * 
     * The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
     * field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
     * 
     * The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
     * be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
     * application with debugging enabled.
     * 
     * Users with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref.
     * 
     * #### Merged branch response
     * You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
     * a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
     * *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
     * *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
     * *   There are no merge conflicts
     * 
     * If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
     * response.
     * 
     * #### Merge conflict response
     * This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
     * be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.
     * 
     * #### Failed commit status checks
     * This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
     * status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do this call to create the tag object, and then [create](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#create-a-reference) the `refs/tags/[tag]` reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to [create](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#create-a-reference) the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.

     * these docs to reflect relevant changes to the API and will contact all integrators using the "Source imports" API.
     * 
     * **Import status**
     * 
     * This section includes details about the possible values of the `status` field of the Import Progress response.
     * 
     * An import that does not have errors will progress through these steps:
     * 
     * *   `detecting` - the "detection" step of the import is in progress because the request did not include a `vcs` parameter. The import is identifying the type of source control present at the URL.
     * *   `importing` - the "raw" step of the import is in progress. This is where commit data is fetched from the original repository. The import progress response will include `commit_count` (the total number of raw commits that will be imported) and `percent` (0 - 100, the current progress through the import).
     * *   `mapping` - the "rewrite" step of the import is in progress. This is where SVN branches are converted to Git branches, and where author updates are applied. The import progress response does not include progress information.
     * *   `pushing` - the "push" step of the import is in progress. This is where the importer updates the repository on GitHub. The import progress response will include `push_percent`, which is the percent value reported by `git push` when it is "Writing objects".
     * *   `complete` - the import is complete, and the repository is ready on GitHub.
     * 
     * If there are problems, you will see one of these in the `status` field:
     * 
     * *   `auth_failed` - the import requires authentication in order to connect to the original repository. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#update-an-import) section.
     * *   `error` - the import encountered an error. The import progress response will include the `failed_step` and an error message. Contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api) for more information.
     * *   `detection_needs_auth` - the importer requires authentication for the originating repository to continue detection. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#update-an-import) section.
     * *   `detection_found_nothing` - the importer didn't recognize any source control at the URL. To resolve, [Cancel the import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#cancel-an-import) and [retry](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#start-an-import) with the correct URL.
     * *   `detection_found_multiple` - the importer found several projects or repositories at the provided URL. When this is the case, the Import Progress response will also include a `project_choices` field with the possible project choices as values. To update project choice, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#update-an-import) section.
     * 
     * **The project_choices field**
     * 
     * When multiple projects are found at the provided URL, the response hash will include a `project_choices` field, the value of which is an array of hashes each representing a project choice. The exact key/value pairs of the project hashes will differ depending on the version control type.
     * 
     * **Git LFS related fields**
     * 
     * This section includes details about Git LFS related fields that may be present in the Import Progress response.
     * 
     * *   `use_lfs` - describes whether the import has been opted in or out of using Git LFS. The value can be `opt_in`, `opt_out`, or `undecided` if no action has been taken.
     * *   `has_large_files` - the boolean value describing whether files larger than 100MB were found during the `importing` step.
     * *   `large_files_size` - the total size in gigabytes of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository.
     * *   `large_files_count` - the total number of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository. To see a list of these files, make a "Get Large Files" request.

       * @example # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
       * 
       * ## Our Pledge
       * 
       * In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
       * 
       * ## Our Standards
       * 
       * Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
       * 
       * * Using welcoming and inclusive language
       * * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
       * * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
       * * Focusing on what is best for the community
       * * Showing empathy towards other community members
       * 
       * Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
       * 
       * * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
       * * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
       * * Public or private harassment
       * * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
       * * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
       * 
       * ## Our Responsibilities
       * 
       * Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
       *                   to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
       * 
       * Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
       * 
       * ## Scope
       * 
       * This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
       *                   posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
       * 
       * ## Enforcement
       * 
       * Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
       * 
       * Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
       * 
       * ## Attribution
       * 
       * This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]

   *   return b64encode(encrypted).decode("utf-8")
   * ```
   * 
   * #### Example encrypting a secret using C#
   * 
   * Encrypt your secret using the [Sodium.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sodium.Core/) package.

   * Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.
   * 
   * **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."
   * 
   * An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the team's organization to a team. When an organization owner adds someone to a team who is not an organization member, this endpoint will send an invitation to the person via email. This newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until the person accepts the invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team.
   * 
   * If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.
   * 
   * **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PUT /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.

   * 
   * #### Example encrypting a secret using Node.js
   * 
   * Encrypt your secret using the [libsodium-wrappers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsodium-wrappers) library.
   * 
   * ```
   * const sodium = require('libsodium-wrappers')
   * const secret = 'plain-text-secret' // replace with the secret you want to encrypt
   * const key = 'base64-encoded-public-key' // replace with the Base64 encoded public key
   * 
   * //Check if libsodium is ready and then proceed.
   * sodium.ready.then(() => {
   *   // Convert Secret & Base64 key to Uint8Array.
   *   let binkey = sodium.from_base64(key, sodium.base64_variants.ORIGINAL)
   *   let binsec = sodium.from_string(secret)
   * 
   *   //Encrypt the secret using LibSodium
   *   let encBytes = sodium.crypto_box_seal(binsec, binkey)
   * 
   *   // Convert encrypted Uint8Array to Base64
   *   let output = sodium.to_base64(encBytes, sodium.base64_variants.ORIGINAL)
   * 
   *   console.log(output)
   * });
   * ```
   * 
   * #### Example encrypting a secret using Python
   * 
   * Encrypt your secret using [pynacl](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public/#nacl-public-sealedbox) with Python 3.
   * 
   * ```
   * from base64 import b64encode
   * from nacl import encoding, public
   * 
   * def encrypt(public_key: str, secret_value: str) -> str:
   *   """Encrypt a Unicode string using the public key."""
   *   public_key = public.PublicKey(public_key.encode("utf-8"), encoding.Base64Encoder())
   *   sealed_box = public.SealedBox(public_key)
   *   encrypted = sealed_box.encrypt(secret_value.encode("utf-8"))
   *   return b64encode(encrypted).decode("utf-8")
   * ```
   * 
   * #### Example encrypting a secret using C#
   * 
   * Encrypt your secret using the [Sodium.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sodium.Core/) package.
   * 
   * ```
   * var secretValue = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("mySecret");
   * var publicKey = Convert.FromBase64String("2Sg8iYjAxxmI2LvUXpJjkYrMxURPc8r+dB7TJyvvcCU=");
   * 
   * var sealedPublicKeyBox = Sodium.SealedPublicKeyBox.Create(secretValue, publicKey);
   * 
   * Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToBase64String(sealedPublicKeyBox));
   * ```
   * 
   * #### Example encrypting a secret using Ruby
   * 
   * Encrypt your secret using the [rbnacl](https://github.com/RubyCrypto/rbnacl) gem.
   * 
   * ```ruby
   * require "rbnacl"
   * require "base64"
   * 
   * key = Base64.decode64("+ZYvJDZMHUfBkJdyq5Zm9SKqeuBQ4sj+6sfjlH4CgG0=")
   * public_key = RbNaCl::PublicKey.new(key)
   * 
   * box = RbNaCl::Boxes::Sealed.from_public_key(public_key)
   * encrypted_secret = box.encrypt("my_secret")
   * 
   * # Print the base64 encoded secret
   * puts Base64.strict_encode64(encrypted_secret)

   * Delete a code scanning analysis from a repository 
   * @description Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository. For

   * you must use an access token with `public_repo` scope.
   * GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` write permission to use this endpoint.
   * 
   * You can delete one analysis at a time.
   * To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.
   * Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
   * 
   * When you list the analyses for a repository,
   * one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
   * 
   * ```
   * "deletable": true
   * ```
   * 
   * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
   * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
   * for each enabled code scanning tool,
   * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
   * 
   * * `ref`
   * * `tool`
   * * `category`
   * 
   * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
   * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
   * 
   * ```
   * Analysis specified is not deletable.
   * ```
   * 
   * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
   * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:
   * `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.
   * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
   * in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
   * for the specified tool in your repository.
   * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
   * When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
   * in the 200 response is `null`.
   * 
   * As an example of the deletion process,
   * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
   * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
   * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
   * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
   * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
   * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
   * To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
   * Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.
   * Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
   * delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
   * Then repeat the process for the second set.
   * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
   * 
   * **Outer loop**:
   * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
   * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
   * 
   *   **Inner loop**:
   *   * Delete the identified analysis.
   *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
   * 
   * The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

   * Upload an analysis as SARIF data 
   * @description Uploads SARIF data containing the results of a code scanning analysis to make the results available in a repository. You must use an access token with the `security_events` scope to use this endpoint for private repositories. You can also use tokens with the `public_repo` scope for public repositories only. GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` write permission to use this endpoint.
   * 
   * There are two places where you can upload code scanning results.
   *  - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see "[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests)."
   *  - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see "[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository)."
   * 
   * You must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using `gzip`, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:
   * 
   * ```
   * gzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0
   * ```
   * <br>
   * SARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.
   * To get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration. For example, for the CodeQL tool, identify and remove the most noisy queries.
   *

   * 
   * Encrypt your secret using the [libsodium-wrappers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsodium-wrappers) library.
   * 
   * ```
   * const sodium = require('libsodium-wrappers')

   * 
   *   console.log(output)
   * });
   * ```

   * #### Example of encrypting a secret using Python
   * 
   * Encrypt your secret using [pynacl](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public/#nacl-public-sealedbox) with Python 3.
   * 
   * ```
   * from base64 import b64encode
   * from nacl import encoding, public
   * 
   * def encrypt(public_key: str, secret_value: str) -> str:

   *   encrypted = sealed_box.encrypt(secret_value.encode("utf-8"))
   *   return b64encode(encrypted).decode("utf-8")
   * ```
   * 
   * #### Example of encrypting a secret using C#
   * 
   * Encrypt your secret using the [Sodium.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sodium.Core/) package.
   * 
   * ```
   * var secretValue = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("mySecret");
   * var publicKey = Convert.FromBase64String("2Sg8iYjAxxmI2LvUXpJjkYrMxURPc8r+dB7TJyvvcCU=");

   * 
   * The API response includes details about the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.
   * 
   * When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison.
   * 
   * **Working with large comparisons**
   * 
   * To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using pagination:
   * 
   * - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison.
   * - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.
   * 
   * For more information on working with pagination, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

   * #### If the content is a directory
   * The response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory.
   * When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value
   * _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists in API v3 [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW).
   * In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".
   * 
   * #### If the content is a symlink 
   * If the requested `:path` points to a symlink, and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the
   * API responds with the content of the file (in the format shown in the example. Otherwise, the API responds with an object 
   * describing the symlink itself.
   * 
   * #### If the content is a submodule
   * The `submodule_git_url` identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific
   * commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out
   * the submodule at that specific commit.
   * 
   * If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the
   * github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.

  /**
   * Create a deployment 
   * @description Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.
   * 
   * The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
   * before we merge a pull request.
   * 
   * The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
   * multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
   * makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
   * 
   * The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
   * the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
   * the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
   * return a failure response.
   * 
   * By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
   * state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
   * specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
   * not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
   * 
   * The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
   * field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
   * 
   * The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
   * be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
   * application with debugging enabled.
   * 
   * Users with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref.
   * 
   * #### Merged branch response
   * You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
   * a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
   * *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
   * *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
   * *   There are no merge conflicts
   * 
   * If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
   * response.
   * 
   * #### Merge conflict response
   * This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
   * be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.
   * 
   * #### Failed commit status checks
   * This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
   * status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

   * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
   * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
   * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
   * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
   * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
   * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
   * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
   * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
   * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
   * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

   * these docs to reflect relevant changes to the API and will contact all integrators using the "Source imports" API.
   * 
   * **Import status**
   * 
   * This section includes details about the possible values of the `status` field of the Import Progress response.
   * 
   * An import that does not have errors will progress through these steps:
   * 
   * *   `detecting` - the "detection" step of the import is in progress because the request did not include a `vcs` parameter. The import is identifying the type of source control present at the URL.
   * *   `importing` - the "raw" step of the import is in progress. This is where commit data is fetched from the original repository. The import progress response will include `commit_count` (the total number of raw commits that will be imported) and `percent` (0 - 100, the current progress through the import).
   * *   `mapping` - the "rewrite" step of the import is in progress. This is where SVN branches are converted to Git branches, and where author updates are applied. The import progress response does not include progress information.
   * *   `pushing` - the "push" step of the import is in progress. This is where the importer updates the repository on GitHub. The import progress response will include `push_percent`, which is the percent value reported by `git push` when it is "Writing objects".
   * *   `complete` - the import is complete, and the repository is ready on GitHub.
   * 
   * If there are problems, you will see one of these in the `status` field:
   * 
   * *   `auth_failed` - the import requires authentication in order to connect to the original repository. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#update-an-import) section.
   * *   `error` - the import encountered an error. The import progress response will include the `failed_step` and an error message. Contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api) for more information.
   * *   `detection_needs_auth` - the importer requires authentication for the originating repository to continue detection. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#update-an-import) section.
   * *   `detection_found_nothing` - the importer didn't recognize any source control at the URL. To resolve, [Cancel the import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#cancel-an-import) and [retry](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#start-an-import) with the correct URL.
   * *   `detection_found_multiple` - the importer found several projects or repositories at the provided URL. When this is the case, the Import Progress response will also include a `project_choices` field with the possible project choices as values. To update project choice, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#update-an-import) section.
   * 
   * **The project_choices field**
   * 
   * When multiple projects are found at the provided URL, the response hash will include a `project_choices` field, the value of which is an array of hashes each representing a project choice. The exact key/value pairs of the project hashes will differ depending on the version control type.
   * 
   * **Git LFS related fields**
   * 
   * This section includes details about Git LFS related fields that may be present in the Import Progress response.
   * 
   * *   `use_lfs` - describes whether the import has been opted in or out of using Git LFS. The value can be `opt_in`, `opt_out`, or `undecided` if no action has been taken.
   * *   `has_large_files` - the boolean value describing whether files larger than 100MB were found during the `importing` step.
   * *   `large_files_size` - the total size in gigabytes of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository.
   * *   `large_files_count` - the total number of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository. To see a list of these files, make a "Get Large Files" request.

This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the `mergeable` key. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".
   * 
   * The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.
   * 
   * The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:
   * 
   * *   If merged as a [merge commit](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.
   * *   If merged via a [squash](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch.
   * *   If [rebased](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.

The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.

   * 
   * The `position` value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@" hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.

  /**
   * Upload a release asset 
   * @description This endpoint makes use of [a Hypermedia relation](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in
   * the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.
   * 
   * You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.
   * 
   * Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example: 
   * 
   * `application/zip`
   * 
   * GitHub expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
   * you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.
   * 
   * When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.
   * 
   * **Notes:**
   * *   GitHub renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List assets for a release](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#list-assets-for-a-release)"
   * endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).
   * *   To find the `release_id` query the [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release). 
   * *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset.

   * Search code 
   * @description Searches for query terms inside of a file. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#pagination).
   * 
   * When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).
   * 
   * For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this:
   * 
   * `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`
   * 
   * This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery/jquery` repository.
   * 
   * #### Considerations for code search
   * 
   * Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
   * 
   * *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.
   * *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
   * *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing
   * language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.
   * 
   * This endpoint requires you to authenticate and limits you to 10 requests per minute.

   *   return b64encode(encrypted).decode("utf-8")
   * ```
   * 
   * #### Example encrypting a secret using C#
   * 
   * Encrypt your secret using the [Sodium.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sodium.Core/) package.

   *   - The same package namespace and version is still available and not reused for a new package. If the same package namespace is not available, you will not be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted package, you must delete the new package that uses the deleted package's namespace first.
   * 
   * To use this endpoint, you must authenticate using an access token with the `read:packages` and `write:packages` scopes. In addition:
   * - If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, your token must also include the `repo` scope. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."
   * - If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that supports granular permissions, you must have admin permissions to the package whose version you want to restore. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."
