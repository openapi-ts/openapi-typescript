# Contributing to openapi-typescript docs

## Setup

See the [README](./README.md) for basic setup.

## Corrections / small edits

Corrections are always welcome! Please go straight to [opening a PR](https://github.com/openapi-ts/openapi-typescript/pulls) for correcting typos or misinformation. Small grammar edits are also welcome such as shortening verbose language or clarifying confusing statements.

## Styling fixes

Styling fixes are also welcome (contrast improvements, styling bugs, general frontend improvements). You can also go straight to [opening a PR](https://github.com/openapi-ts/openapi-typescript/pulls) for those.

## Additions & Larger edits

[Opening a new discussion](https://github.com/openapi-ts/openapi-typescript/discussions) would be appreciated for all of the following:

- Adding a new section or page
- Restructuring the docs
- Major rewrites

All of the above are welcome! But if you just opened a PR without discussing the plan ahead-of-time, it will probably be rejected. Be sure to save your own time by talking about big changes first!

## Code of Conduct

All docs edits are held accountable to the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) outlined in this project. Language in the documentation must be inclusive, kind, and respectful.
