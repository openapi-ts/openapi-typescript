# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The `useSuspenseQuery` method allows you to use the original [useSuspenseQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/suspense).

- The result is the same as the original function.
- The `functionKey` is `[method, path, params]`.
- `data` and `error` are fully typed.
- You can pass queries options as fourth parameter.

::: tip
You can find more information about `useSuspenseQuery` on the [@tanstack/react-query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/suspense).

    params: {
      path: { user_id: 5 },
    },
  });

  return <div>{data.firstname}</div>;
};

  return (
    <ErrorBoundary fallbackRender={({ error }) => `Error: ${error.message}`}>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
