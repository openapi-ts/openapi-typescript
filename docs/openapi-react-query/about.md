# About

## Project Goals

1. Types should be strict and inferred automatically from OpenAPI schemas with the absolute minimum number of generics needed.
2. Respect the original `@tanstack/react-query` APIs while reducing boilerplate.
3. Be as light and performant as possible.

## Contributors

This library wouldnâ€™t be possible without all these amazing contributors:

<VPTeamMembers size="small" :members="contributors['openapi-react-query']" />
