# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The `useMutation` method allows you to use the original [useMutation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/mutations).

- The result is the same as the original function.
- The `mutationKey` is `[method, path]`.
- `data` and `error` are fully typed.

::: tip
You can find more information about `useMutation` on the [@tanstack/react-query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/mutations).

      Update
    </button>
  );
};
```

```ts [src/api.ts]
import createFetchClient from "openapi-fetch";
