# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The `useMutation` method allows you to use the original [useMutation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/queries).

- The result is the same as the original function.
- The `mutationKey` is `[method, path]`.
- `data` and `error` are fully typed.

::: tip
You can find more information about `useMutation` on the [@tanstack/react-query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/mutations).

## Example

    <button onClick={() => mutate({ body: { firstname: "John" } })}>
      Update
    </button>
  );
};
```

```ts [src/api.ts]
import createFetchClient from "openapi-fetch";
import createClient from "openapi-react-query";
import type { paths } from "./my-openapi-3-schema"; // generated by openapi-typescript

const fetchClient = createFetchClient<paths>({
