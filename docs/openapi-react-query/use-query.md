title: useQuery

# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The `useQuery` method allows you to use the original [useQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/queries).

- The result is the same as the original function.
- The `functionKey` is `[method, path, params]`.
- `data` and `error` are fully typed.
- You can pass queries options as fourth parameter.

::: tip
You can find more information about `useQuery` on the [@tanstack/react-query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/queries).

## Example

::: code-group

```tsx [src/app.tsx]
import { $api } from "./api";

export const App = () => {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = $api.useQuery("get", "/users/{user_id}", {
    params: {
      path: { user_id: 5 },
    },
  });

  if (!data || isLoading) return "Loading...";
  if (error) return `An error occured: ${error.message}`;

  return <div>{data.firstname}</div>;
};
```

```ts [src/api.ts]
import createFetchClient from "openapi-fetch";
import createClient from "openapi-react-query";
import type { paths } from "./my-openapi-3-schema"; // generated by openapi-typescript

const fetchClient = createFetchClient<paths>({
  baseUrl: "https://myapi.dev/v1/",
});
export const $api = createClient(fetchClient);
