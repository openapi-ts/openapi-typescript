# Examples

Example code of using openapi-fetch with other frameworks and libraries.

## React + React Query

[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) is a perfect wrapper for openapi-fetch in React. At only 13 kB, it provides clientside caching without too much client weight in return. And its stellar type inference preserves openapi-fetch types perfectly with minimal setup.

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the most popular SSR framework for React. While [React Query](#react--react-query) is recommended for all clientside fetching with openapi-fetch (not SWR), this example shows how to take advantage of Next.js’s [server-side fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-server-with-fetch) with built-in caching.

## Svelte / SvelteKit

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)’s automatic type inference can easily pick up openapi-fetch’s types in both clientside fetching and [Page Data](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#page-data) fetching. And it doesn’t need any additional libraries to work. SvelteKit also advises to use their [custom fetch](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#making-fetch-requests) in load functions. This can be achieved with [fetch options](/openapi-fetch/api#fetch-options).

_Note: if you’re using Svelte without SvelteKit, the root example in `src/routes/+page.svelte` doesn’t use any SvelteKit features and is generally-applicable to any setup._

## Vue 3

[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) is a popular framework with a large ecosystem. Vue 3’s Composition API is a perfect match for openapi-fetch, as it allows for easy separation of concerns and reactivity.
