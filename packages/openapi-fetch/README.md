openapi-fetch is a type-safe fetch client that pulls in your OpenAPI schema. Weighs **6 kb** and has virtually zero runtime. Works with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS.

| Library                    | Size (min) | ‚ÄúGET‚Äù request\*            |
| :------------------------- | ---------: | :------------------------- |

| openapi-typescript-fetch   |     `3 kB` | `300k` ops/s (fastest)     |
| feature-fetch              |    `15 kB` | `300k` ops/s (fastest)     |

_\* [Benchmarks are approximate](https://github.com/openapi-ts/openapi-typescript/blob/main/packages/openapi-fetch/test/index.bench.js) to just show rough baseline and will differ among machines and browsers. The relative performance between libraries is more reliable._

The syntax is inspired by popular libraries like react-query or Apollo client, but without all the bells and whistles and in a 6 kb package.

```ts
import createClient from "openapi-fetch";
import type { paths } from "./my-openapi-3-schema"; // generated by openapi-typescript

const client = createClient<paths>({ baseUrl: "https://myapi.dev/v1/" });

const {
  data, // only present if 2XX response
  error, // only present if 4XX or 5XX response
} = await client.GET("/blogposts/{post_id}", {
  params: {
    path: { post_id: "123" },
  },
});

await client.PUT("/blogposts", {
  body: {
    title: "My New Post",
  },
});
```

`data` and `error` are typechecked and expose their shapes to Intellisense in VS Code (and any other IDE with TypeScript support). Likewise, the request `body` will also typecheck its fields, erring if any required params are missing, or if there‚Äôs a type mismatch.

`GET()`, `PUT()`, `POST()`, etc. are thin wrappers around the native [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) (which you can [swap for any¬†call](https://openapi-ts.dev/openapi-fetch/api/#create-client)).

Notice there are no generics, and no manual typing. Your endpoint‚Äôs request and response were inferred automatically. This is a huge improvement in the type safety of your endpoints because **every manual assertion could lead to a bug**! This eliminates all of the following:

- ‚úÖ No typos in URLs or params
- ‚úÖ All parameters, request bodies, and responses are type-checked and 100% match your schema
- ‚úÖ No manual typing of your API
- ‚úÖ Eliminates `any` types that hide bugs
- ‚úÖ Also eliminates `as` type overrides that can also hide bugs
- ‚úÖ All of this in a **6 kb** client package üéâ

## Setup

Install this library along with [openapi-typescript](../openapi-typescript):

```bash
npm i openapi-fetch
npm i -D openapi-typescript typescript
```

> **Highly recommended**
>
> Enable [noUncheckedIndexedAccess](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noUncheckedIndexedAccess) in your `tsconfig.json` ([docs](/advanced#enable-nouncheckedindexaccess-in-your-tsconfigjson))

Next, generate TypeScript types from your OpenAPI schema using openapi-typescript:

```bash
npx openapi-typescript ./path/to/api/v1.yaml -o ./src/lib/api/v1.d.ts
```

Lastly, be sure to **run typechecking** in your project. This can be done by adding `tsc --noEmit` to your [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts) like¬†so:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:ts": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

And run `npm run test:ts` in your CI to catch type¬†errors.

> **TIP:**
>
> Use `tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors rather than relying on your linter or your build command. Nothing will typecheck as accurately as the TypeScript compiler itself.

## Basic usage

The best part about using openapi-fetch over oldschool codegen is no documentation needed. openapi-fetch encourages using your existing OpenAPI documentation rather than trying to find what function to import, or what parameters that function wants:

![OpenAPI schema example](../../docs/public/assets/openapi-schema.png)

```ts
import createClient from "openapi-fetch";
import type { paths } from "./my-openapi-3-schema"; // generated by openapi-typescript

const client = createClient<paths>({ baseUrl: "https://myapi.dev/v1/" });

const { data, error } = await client.GET("/blogposts/{post_id}", {
  params: {
    path: { post_id: "my-post" },
    query: { version: 2 },
  },
});

const { data, error } = await client.PUT("/blogposts", {
  body: {
    title: "New Post",
    body: "<p>New post body</p>",
    publish_date: new Date("2023-03-01T12:00:00Z").getTime(),
  },
});
```

1. The HTTP method is pulled directly from `createClient()`
2. You pass in your desired `path` to `GET()`, `PUT()`, etc.
3. TypeScript takes over the rest and returns helpful errors for anything missing or invalid
