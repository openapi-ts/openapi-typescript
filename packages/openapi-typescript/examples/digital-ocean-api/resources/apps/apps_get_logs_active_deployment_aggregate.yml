summary: Retrieve Active Deployment Aggregate Logs

description: Retrieve the logs of the active deployment if one exists. The 
  response will include links to either real-time logs of an in-progress or
  active deployment or archived logs of a past deployment. Note log_type=BUILD
  logs will return logs associated with the current active deployment (being
  served). To view build logs associated with in-progress build, the query must
  explicitly reference the deployment id.
