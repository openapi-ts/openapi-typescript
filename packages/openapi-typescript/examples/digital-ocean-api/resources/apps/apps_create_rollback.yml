operationId: apps_create_rollback

summary: Rollback App

description: |
  Rollback an app to a previous deployment. A new deployment will be created to perform the rollback.
  The app will be pinned to the rollback deployment preventing any new deployments from being created,
  either manually or through Auto Deploy on Push webhooks. To resume deployments, the rollback must be
  either committed or reverted.

  It is recommended to use the Validate App Rollback endpoint to double check if the rollback is
  valid and if there are any warnings.
