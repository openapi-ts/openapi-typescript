summary: Delete a VPC

description: |
  To delete a VPC, send a DELETE request to `/v2/vpcs/$VPC_ID`. A 204 status
  code with no body will be returned in response to a successful request.

  The default VPC for a region can not be deleted. Additionally, a VPC can only
  be deleted if it does not contain any member resources. Attempting to delete
  a region's default VPC or a VPC that still has members will result in a
  403 Forbidden error response.
