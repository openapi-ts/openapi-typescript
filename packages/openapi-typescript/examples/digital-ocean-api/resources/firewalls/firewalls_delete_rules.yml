summary: Remove Rules from a Firewall

description: |
  To remove access rules from a firewall, send a DELETE request to
  `/v2/firewalls/$FIREWALL_ID/rules`. The body of the request may include an
  `inbound_rules` and/or `outbound_rules` attribute containing an array of rules
  to be removed.

  No response body will be sent back, but the response code will indicate
  success. Specifically, the response code will be a 204, which means that the
  action was successful with no returned body data.
