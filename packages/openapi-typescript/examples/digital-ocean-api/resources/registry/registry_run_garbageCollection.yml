summary: Start Garbage Collection

description: |
  Garbage collection enables users to clear out unreferenced blobs (layer &
  manifest data) after deleting one or more manifests from a repository. If
  there are no unreferenced blobs resulting from the deletion of one or more
  manifests, garbage collection is effectively a noop.
  [See here for more information](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/container-registry/how-to/clean-up-container-registry/)
  about how and why you should clean up your container registry periodically.

  To request a garbage collection run on your registry, send a POST request to
  `/v2/registry/$REGISTRY_NAME/garbage-collection`. This will initiate the
  following sequence of events on your registry.

  * Set the registry to read-only mode, meaning no further write-scoped
    JWTs will be issued to registry clients. Existing write-scoped JWTs will
    continue to work until they expire which can take up to 15 minutes.
  * Wait until all existing write-scoped JWTs have expired.
  * Scan all registry manifests to determine which blobs are unreferenced.
  * Delete all unreferenced blobs from the registry.
  * Record the number of blobs deleted and bytes freed, mark the garbage
    collection status as `success`.
  * Remove the read-only mode restriction from the registry, meaning write-scoped
    JWTs will once again be issued to registry clients.
