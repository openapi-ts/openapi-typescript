    The `type` field dictates what type of entity that the alert policy applies to and hence what type of entity is passed in the `entities` array. If both the `tags` array and `entities` array are empty the alert policy applies to all entities of the relevant type that are owned by the user account. Otherwise the following table shows the valid entity types for each type of alert policy:
