summary: Purge the Cache for an Existing CDN Endpoint

description: |
  To purge cached content from a CDN endpoint, send a DELETE request to
  `/v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache`. The body of the request should include
  a `files` attribute containing a list of cached file paths to be purged. A
  path may be for a single file or may contain a wildcard (`*`) to recursively
  purge all files under a directory. When only a wildcard is provided, all cached 
  files will be purged. There is a rate limit of 50 files per 20 seconds that can 
  be purged. CDN endpoints have a rate limit of 5 requests per 10 seconds. 
  Purging files using a wildcard path counts as a single request against the API's 
  rate limit. Two identical purge requests cannot be sent at the same time.
