summary: Purge the Cache for an Existing CDN Endpoint

description: |
  To purge cached content from a CDN endpoint, send a DELETE request to
  `/v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache`. The body of the request should include
  a `files` attribute containing a list of cached file paths to be purged. A
  path may be for a single file or may contain a wildcard (`*`) to recursively
  purge all files under a directory. When only a wildcard is provided, all
  cached files will be purged. There is a rate limit of 50 files per 20 seconds 
  that can be purged.
