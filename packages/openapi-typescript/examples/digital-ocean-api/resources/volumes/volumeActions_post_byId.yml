summary: Initiate A Block Storage Action By Volume Id

description: |
  To initiate an action on a block storage volume by Id, send a POST request to
  `~/v2/volumes/$VOLUME_ID/actions`. The body should contain the appropriate
  attributes for the respective action.

  ## Attach a Block Storage Volume to a Droplet

  | Attribute  | Details                                                             |
  | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | type       | This must be `attach`                                               |
  | droplet_id | Set to the Droplet's ID                                             |
  | region     | Set to the slug representing the region where the volume is located |

  Each volume may only be attached to a single Droplet. However, up to seven
  volumes may be attached to a Droplet at a time. Pre-formatted volumes will be
  automatically mounted to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Fedora Atomic, and CentOS
  Droplets created on or after April 26, 2018 when attached. On older Droplets,
  [additional configuration](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-partition-and-format-digitalocean-block-storage-volumes-in-linux#mounting-the-filesystems)
  is required.

  ## Remove a Block Storage Volume from a Droplet

  | Attribute  | Details                                                             |
  | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | type       | This must be `detach`                                               |
  | droplet_id | Set to the Droplet's ID                                             |
  | region     | Set to the slug representing the region where the volume is located |

  ## Resize a Volume

  | Attribute      | Details                                                             |
  | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | type           | This must be `resize`                                               |
  | size_gigabytes | The new size of the block storage volume in GiB (1024^3)            |
  | region         | Set to the slug representing the region where the volume is located |

  Volumes may only be resized upwards. The maximum size for a volume is 16TiB.
