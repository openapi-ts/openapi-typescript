  | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | type        | This must be `attach`                                               |
  | volume_name | The name of the block storage volume                                |

  | region      | Set to the slug representing the region where the volume is located |

  Each volume may only be attached to a single Droplet. However, up to fifteen
  volumes may be attached to a Droplet at a time. Pre-formatted volumes will be
  automatically mounted to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Fedora Atomic, and CentOS
  Droplets created on or after April 26, 2018 when attached. On older Droplets,
  [additional configuration](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/volumes/how-to/mount/)
  is required.
