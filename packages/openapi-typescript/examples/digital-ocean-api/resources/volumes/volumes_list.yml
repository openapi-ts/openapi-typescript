summary: List All Block Storage Volumes

description: >+
  To list all of the block storage volumes available on your account, send a GET
  request to `/v2/volumes`.

  ## Filtering Results

  ### By Region

  The `region` may be provided as query parameter in order to restrict results
  to volumes available in a specific region.
  For example: `/v2/volumes?region=nyc1`

  ### By Name

  It is also possible to list volumes on your account that match a specified
  name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name as a query parameter
  to `/v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME`.

  **Note:** You can only create one volume per region with the same name.

  ### By Name and Region

  It is also possible to retrieve information about a block storage volume by
  name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name and the region slug
  for the region it is located in as query parameters to
  `/v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME&region=nyc1`.
