summary: Delete a Block Storage Volume by Name

description: >+
  Block storage volumes may also be deleted by name by sending a DELETE request
  with the volume's **name** and the **region slug** for the region it is
  located in as query parameters to `/v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME&region=nyc1`.

  No response body will be sent back, but the response code will indicate
  success. Specifically, the response code will be a 204, which means that the
  action was successful with no returned body data.
