    example: 3
    description: How many nodes the load balancer contains. Each additional
      node increases the load balancer's ability to manage more connections.
      Load balancers can be scaled up or down, and you can change the number of
      nodes after creation up to once per hour. This field is currently not
      available in the AMS2, NYC2, or SFO1 regions. Use the `size` field to
      scale load balancers that reside in these regions.

    description: This field has been replaced by the `size_unit` field for all
      regions except in AMS2, NYC2, and SFO1. Each available load balancer size
      now equates to the load balancer having a set number of nodes.

      * `lb-small` = 1 node

      * `lb-medium` = 3 nodes

      * `lb-large` = 6 nodes


      You can resize load balancers after creation up to once per hour. You
