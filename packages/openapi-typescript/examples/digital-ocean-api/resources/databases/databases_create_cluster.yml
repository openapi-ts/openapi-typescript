summary: Create a New Database Cluster

description: >-
  To create a database cluster, send a POST request to `/v2/databases`.

  The response will be a JSON object with a key called `database`. The value of this
  will be an object that contains the standard attributes associated with a database
  cluster. The initial value of the database cluster's `status` attribute will be
  `creating`. When the cluster is ready to receive traffic, this will transition to
  `online`.


  The embedded `connection` and `private_connection` objects will contain the
  information needed to access the database cluster. For multi-node clusters, the
  `standby_connection` and `standby_private_connection` objects will contain the information
  needed to connect to the cluster's standby node(s).


  DigitalOcean managed PostgreSQL and MySQL database clusters take automated daily backups.
  To create a new database cluster based on a backup of an existing cluster, send a POST
  request to `/v2/databases`. In addition to the standard database cluster attributes, the
  JSON body must include a key named `backup_restore` with the name of the original
  database cluster and the timestamp of the backup to be restored. Creating a database
  from a backup is the same as forking a database in the control panel.

  Note: Backups are not supported for Redis clusters.
