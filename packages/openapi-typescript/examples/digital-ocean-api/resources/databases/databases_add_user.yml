summary: Add a Database User

description: |
  To add a new database user, send a POST request to `/v2/databases/$DATABASE_ID/users`
  with the desired username.

  Note: User management is not supported for Redis clusters.

  When adding a user to a MySQL cluster, additional options can be configured in the
  `mysql_settings` object.

  When adding a user to a Kafka cluster, additional options can be configured in
  the `settings` object.

  The response will be a JSON object with a key called `user`. The value of this will be an
  object that contains the standard attributes associated with a database user including
  its randomly generated password.
