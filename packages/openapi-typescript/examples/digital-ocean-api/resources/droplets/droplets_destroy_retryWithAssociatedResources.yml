summary: Retry a Droplet Destroy with Associated Resources Request

description: |
  If the status of a request to destroy a Droplet with its associated resources
  reported any errors, it can be retried by sending a POST request to the
  `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/destroy_with_associated_resources/retry` endpoint.

  Only one destroy can be active at a time per Droplet. If a retry is issued
  while another destroy is in progress for the Droplet a 409 status code will
  be returned. A successful response will include a 202 response code and no
  content.
