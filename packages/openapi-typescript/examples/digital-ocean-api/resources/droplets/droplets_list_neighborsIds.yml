summary: List All Droplet Neighbors

description: |
  To retrieve a list of all Droplets that are co-located on the same physical
  hardware, send a GET request to `/v2/reports/droplet_neighbors_ids`.

  The results will be returned as a JSON object with a key of `neighbor_ids`.
  This will be set to an array of arrays. Each array will contain a set of
  Droplet IDs for Droplets that share a physical server. An empty array
  indicates that all Droplets associated with your account are located on
  separate physical hardware.
