summary: Create a New Droplet

description: |
  To create a new Droplet, send a POST request to `/v2/droplets` setting the
  required attributes.

  A Droplet will be created using the provided information. The response body
  will contain a JSON object with a key called `droplet`. The value will be an
  object containing the standard attributes for your new Droplet. The response
  code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of the operation,
  just that the request has been accepted for processing. The `actions` returned
  as part of the response's `links` object can be used to check the status
  of the Droplet create event.

  ### Create Multiple Droplets

  Creating multiple Droplets is very similar to creating a single Droplet.
  Instead of sending `name` as a string, send `names` as an array of strings. A
  Droplet will be created for each name you send using the associated
  information. Up to ten Droplets may be created this way at a time.

  Rather than returning a single Droplet, the response body will contain a JSON
  array with a key called `droplets`. This will be set to an array of JSON
  objects, each of which will contain the standard Droplet attributes. The
  response code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of any
  operation, just that the request has been accepted for processing. The array
  of `actions` returned as part of the response's `links` object can be used to
  check the status of each individual Droplet create event.
