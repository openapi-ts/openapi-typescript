     * @description **Deprecation Notice:** GitHub Enterprise Server will discontinue the [OAuth Authorizations API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.6/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations/), which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application flow](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.6/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow). The [OAuth Authorizations API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.6/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).
     *
     * If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see "[Working with two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.6/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#working-with-two-factor-authentication)."
     *
     * You can only send one of these scope keys at a time.

However, the returned list of user accounts might not always match the organization or enterprise member list you see on GitHub Enterprise Server. This can happen in certain cases where an external identity associated with an organization will not match an organization member:
     *   - When a user with a SCIM-provisioned external identity is removed from an enterprise, the account's metadata is preserved to allow the user to re-join the organization in the future.

     * 1. The user is granted access by the IdP and is not a member of the GitHub Enterprise Server enterprise.
     *
     * 1. The user attempts to access the GitHub Enterprise Server enterprise and initiates the SAML SSO process, and is not currently signed in to their GitHub Enterprise Server account.
     *
     * 1. After successfully authenticating with the SAML SSO IdP, the `null` external identity entry is created and the user is prompted to sign in to their GitHub Enterprise Server account:
     *    - If the user signs in, their GitHub Enterprise Server account is linked to this entry.

      /**
       * @example # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
       *
       * ## Our Pledge
       *
       * In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
       *
       * ## Our Standards
       *
       * Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
       *
       * * Using welcoming and inclusive language
       * * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
       * * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
       * * Focusing on what is best for the community
       * * Showing empathy towards other community members
       *
       * Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
       *
       * * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
       * * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
       * * Public or private harassment
       * * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
       * * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
       *
       * ## Our Responsibilities
       *
       * Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
       *                   to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
       *
       * Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
       *
       * ## Scope
       *
       * This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
       *                   posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
       *
       * ## Enforcement
       *
       * Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
       *
       * Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
       *
       * ## Attribution
       *
       * This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]

The [OAuth Authorizations API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.6/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).
   *
   * **Warning:** Apps must use the [web application flow](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.6/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow) to obtain OAuth tokens that work with GitHub Enterprise Server SAML organizations. OAuth tokens created using the Authorizations API will be unable to access GitHub Enterprise Server SAML organizations. For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api).
   *
   * This method will create a new authorization for the specified OAuth application, only if an authorization for that application and fingerprint do not already exist for the user. The URL includes the 20 character client ID for the OAuth app that is requesting the token. `fingerprint` is a unique string to distinguish an authorization from others created for the same client ID and user. It returns the user's existing authorization for the application if one is present. Otherwise, it creates and returns a new one.
   *
   * If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens.

   *
   * Retrieves a paginated list of all provisioned enterprise members, including pending invitations.
   *
   * When a user with a SAML-provisioned external identity leaves (or is removed from) an enterprise, the account's metadata is immediately removed. However, the returned list of user accounts might not always match the organization or enterprise member list you see on GitHub Enterprise Server. This can happen in certain cases where an external identity associated with an organization will not match an organization member:
   *   - When a user with a SCIM-provisioned external identity is removed from an enterprise, the account's metadata is preserved to allow the user to re-join the organization in the future.
   *   - When inviting a user to join an organization, you can expect to see their external identity in the results before they accept the invitation, or if the invitation is cancelled (or never accepted).
   *   - When a user is invited over SCIM, an external identity is created that matches with the invitee's email address. However, this identity is only linked to a user account when the user accepts the invitation by going through SAML SSO.
   *
   * The returned list of external identities can include an entry for a `null` user. These are unlinked SAML identities that are created when a user goes through the following Single Sign-On (SSO) process but does not sign in to their GitHub Enterprise Server account after completing SSO:
   *
   * 1. The user is granted access by the IdP and is not a member of the GitHub Enterprise Server enterprise.
   *
   * 1. The user attempts to access the GitHub Enterprise Server enterprise and initiates the SAML SSO process, and is not currently signed in to their GitHub Enterprise Server account.
   *
   * 1. After successfully authenticating with the SAML SSO IdP, the `null` external identity entry is created and the user is prompted to sign in to their GitHub Enterprise Server account:
   *    - If the user signs in, their GitHub Enterprise Server account is linked to this entry.
   *    - If the user does not sign in (or does not create a new account when prompted), they are not added to the GitHub Enterprise Server enterprise, and the external identity `null` entry remains in place.
