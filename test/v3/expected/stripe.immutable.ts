     * customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
     * `charge.succeeded` event.

     * example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
     * `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.
     *
     * As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
     * [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)

     * [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks),
     * and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.
     *
     * When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
     * events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
     * additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.
     *

     * If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your

     * charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
     * per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the

     * SetupIntent
     * @description A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
     * For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
     * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
     *
     * Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
     * Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
     * The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
     * you through the setup process.
     *
     * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
     * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
     * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
     * in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
     * If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
     * it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
     * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
     * PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
     *
     * By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
     * even as regulations change over time.

     * returned to your server to use. You should use our

     * client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server,
     * and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.
     *
     * If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
     * the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if
     * your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance
     * that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
     * client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to
     * Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.
     *
     * Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account
     * information for later use, you can create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)
     * objects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts). Note that

Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.
           *
           * Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.

           * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

           * Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.
